            and it's Supplemental Qualifier dataset by creating one SUPPQUAL for each
            domain dataset. The single SUPPQUAL dataset option that was introduced
            in SDTMIG v3.1.1 is now deprecated. The set of Supplemental Qualifiers
            for each domain is included in a separate dataset with the name SUPP--
            where '--' denotes the source domain which the supplemental Qualifiers
            relate back to.
