As indicated in Tables 3.3.4.3.1 and 3.3.8.1, some common character flags use the scheme Y/null. The choice of Y/N/null vs Y/null is dependent on analysis needs. Y/N/null should be used when N and null values need to be analyzed differently. Y/null can be used when the need is to analyze just the Y values. Corresponding 1/0/null and 1/null schemes apply to numeric flags with variable names that end in FN and which are not population indicators. '"
