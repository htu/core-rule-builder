E.g., they don't have citations. We can make the Citations node optional.\r\n#   CR(2021-09-29): Agree, citations should be optional, as well as ID Version (not in reg. rules) and severity\r\n# How about rules that don't have an origin, e.g., new rules discovered?\r\n#   CR(2021-09-29): Would drive this by what is ultimately deemed the \"single source of truth\"\r\n# Is Id Version mandatory? E.g., adam-cr-3-0 doesn't have a separate version column. They have \"37\", \"37.01\", \"38.01\"...\r\n#   CR(2021-09-29): Strictly speaking, no.  However: \r\n#       1) ADaM will be adopting a distinct version column moving forward (a CROG decision)\r\n#       2) As content is expanded to past and future standards (e.g., SDTMIG 3.3), being able to reference the version would, I think, be helpful\r\n# Nick De Donder asked about Severity as an attribute, similar to adam-cr's Message Type?\r\n#   CR(2021-09-29): Agree it is a consideration, with a range of implications we should discuss.  For example, FDA had established Severity, but recently dropped it.\r\n#       Note Requirement #24 (MVP:\u00a0CORE will support rule exception levels of Error, Warning, and Informational.
